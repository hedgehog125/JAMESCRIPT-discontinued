**Update**: This framework isn't very good and probably doesn't work with newer versions of Phaser so don't use it. Bagel.js replaced it, although I've also moved on from that now.

# JAMESCRIPT (discontinued)
J) JSON | AME) Game | SCRIPT) JavaScript. The easier way to make Phaser games.

# Introduction

I found when I first started Phaser that my code was very repetitive. I was allways writing things like this:

sprite = Game.add.sprite(100, 100, "image")

sprite.width = 100

sprite.height = 100

And my code ended up looking very messy, so I created JAMESCRIPT.

It's simple, you write JSON (with some JavaScript in) to make a game.

It means that your code is a lot more organised: if some code is to do with a sprite you write it in it's code. It makes it a lot easier to find it later.
